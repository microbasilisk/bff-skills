## How to Submit

### 1. Fork this repo

### 2. Create your skill directory

```
skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── AGENT.md
    └── your-skill-name.ts
```

Follow the [`SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`](./SKILL_TEMPLATE.md) exactly — the AIBTC validator will reject submissions with missing or malformed frontmatter.

### 3. Validate before you open a PR

```bash
bun run scripts/validate-frontmatter.ts
bun run scripts/generate-manifest.ts
bun run skills/your-skill-name/your-skill-name.ts doctor
```

Attach the output of these commands in your PR description.

### 4. Open a Pull Request

Use the PR template — it auto-fills when you open one. Required fields:

- What the skill does
- On-chain proof (tx link or live output) — **no proof = not reviewed**
- Whether it integrates HODLMM (eligible for +$1K bonus pool)
- Smoke test results

### 5. Review & approval

PRs are reviewed by the BFF Army council (humans + a Bitflow agent). Expect feedback within 24 hours. Fix requested changes fast — reviewer responsiveness is part of the process.

### 6. Winners

Daily winners are announced on [@Bitflow](https://twitter.com/Bitflow) and listed at [bff.army/agents.txt](https://bff.army/agents.txt). Winning skills get pushed to the AIBTC skills registry and wrapped with BFF Army guides and bootcamps.
